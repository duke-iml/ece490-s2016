    This script generates two Task Input Files [1] designed to be used for 
    testing against the pick and stow tasks defined in the Amazon Picking 
    Challenge 2016 rules.
    
    Note: The script distributes items randomly, which is not be a perfect 
    representation of an actual pick/stow task. During the actual competition, 
    the item distribution will be chosen to present an array of difficulties 
    amongst the bins. Considerations will be made (i.e. for object size, 
    duplicates, point value) that are not reflected in this generator.
    
    
    The 'apc_pick_task.json' file will contain the following json objects:
        - 'bin_contents' will contain the mapping of each bin to its contents, 
          as they exist prior to a task attempt.
        - 'tote_contents' will be an empty list, to properly reflect that the 
          tote is empty at the beginning of the task.
        - 'work_order' will contain a mapping of each bin to the item that is 
          expected to be picked from that bin.
          
        After a pick task attempt, it is expected that the same file format 
        will be returned to the judges. The 'bin_contents' object should 
        appropriately reflect the new status of the bins' contents. The 
        'tote_contents' list should contain the objects that were correctly 
        placed in the tote. The 'work_order' object is ignored.
    
    The 'apc_stow_task.json' file will contain the following json objects:
        - 'bin_contents' will contain the mapping of each bin to its contents, 
          as they exist prior to a task attempt.
        - 'tote_contents' will contain 12 items that are expected to be stowed 
          into the bins.
          
        After a stow task attempt, it is expected that the same file format 
        will be returned to the judges. The 'bin_contents' object should
        appropriately reflect the new status of the bins' contents. The 
        'tote_contents' list should also appropriately reflect the new status 
        of the bins' contents. Items that were not removed from the tote during 
        the attempt should be remain in this list.
